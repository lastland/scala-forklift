Scala-Forklift helps manage and apply database migrations for your Scala project.

Write your migrations in plain SQL:

```scala
MyMigrations.migrations = MyMigrations.migrations :+ SqlMigration(1)(List(
  sqlu"""create table "users" ("id" INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,"first" VARCHAR NOT NULL,"last" VARCHAR NOT NULL)"""
))
```

Or type-safe Slick queries:

``` scala
MyMigrations.migrations = MyMigrations.migrations :+ DBIOMigration(2)(
  DBIO.seq(Users ++= Seq(
    UsersRow(1, "Chris","Vogt"),
    UsersRow(2, "Yao","Li")
  )))
```

Or use [slick-migration-api](https://github.com/nafg/slick-migration-api):

``` scala
MyMigrations.migrations = MyMigrations.migrations :+ APIMigration(3)(
  TableMigration(Users).
    renameColumn(_.first, "firstname").
    renameColumn(_.last, "lastname"))
```

(Note: `APIMigration` is not supported in versions prior to `v0.2.3`)

Don't worry about keeping the Scala code and your database schema consistent. Our source code generator will have it generated for you.

**Key Features**:

- Supports for type-safe database migration with [Slick](https://github.com/slick/slick) and [slick-migration-api](https://github.com/nafg/slick-migration-api).
- A source code generator to generate and manage Scala models from your database schemas.
- A tool to help you manage your dev db with git, with supports for branching and merging.
- High customizability.
